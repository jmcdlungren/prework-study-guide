# Jesse's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal was to create a list of items learned and what made each topic stand out. It helps retain information and provide for a space to look back quickly for each topic, thus seeing a quick summary of what each feature provides and how it benefits the overall webpage / project. While creating it, I learned some basic information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This guide can be used as a quick study and reminder of what HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript do and how each topic benefits us. To be more specific, each section includes notes about that topic, such as how HTML allows us to create the main bones of the webpage and CSS focuses on the style of the webpage. For JavaScript, if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. Based on what was written into the project, along with including the topics we learned from prework, it also advises which topic we should study first.
